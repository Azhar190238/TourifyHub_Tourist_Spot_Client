Here are seven basic features that a land-related website might offer;
 
 1) Home Page: This will be the landing page with a brief description of your application and maybe  carousel or cards displaying some popular tourist spots.
 2) All Tourist Spot Page: This page will display all the tourist spots available in your database.
 3) Add Tourist Spot Page: This page will allow users to add new tourist spots.
 4) My List Page: A private/protected route where users can see the tourist spots they've added to the database.
 5) Update/Delete: Functionality to update or delete a tourist spot, typically accessible from the My List page.

 6) User Registration:  Simple form for users to input basic details (name, email, password). Ensure entered information meets required criteria (valid email format, strong password).

 7) User Login: Form for users to input registered email and password. Option to remember login credentials for convenience. Link or button for password reset, typically involving email confirmation.
