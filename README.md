Here are five basic features that a land-related website might offer;
 
 1) Property Listings: A simple, easy-to-navigate interface displaying available land     properties, including basic details like location, size, and price.

 2) Contact Information: Clear contact information for property owners, real estate agents, or the website administrators, enabling users to inquire about listings or request additional information.

 3) User Registration:  Simple form for users to input basic details (name, email, password). Ensure entered information meets required criteria (valid email format, strong password).

 4) User Login: Form for users to input registered email and password. Option to remember login credentials for convenience. Link or button for password reset, typically involving email confirmation.

 5) Also Photo Galleries: Basic photo galleries accompanying each property listing, showcasing images of the land from different angles and perspectives.
